# Getting Started

Ready to start developing WordPress themes? You’re in the right place.

In this opening chapter, we’ll take a look at what WordPress themes are and how they work. Then, we’ll discuss the GPL, the software license used for WordPress and all of the themes in the WordPress theme directory.

Next, we’ll look at some of the tools you’ll need in your WordPress theme development toolkit and teach you how to setup a local development environment.

We’ll finish up this chapter by looking at a few solid WordPress theme examples.
