# Theme Basics

In Chapter 1, you saw an overview of a theme. You also learned how you can start developing a theme.

In this chapter, you’ll begin learning how to build a theme properly. The anatomy of a theme and its moving parts will be broken down and explained. You’ll begin by understanding the building blocks of a theme by looking at theme files and post types. Then you’ll learn how to keep your files organized within your theme.

You’ll also look at The Loop, which is responsible for pulling content out of the WordPress database.

Finally, you’ll learn more about adding features to your theme by using theme functions, including CSS & JavaScript, leveraging conditional tags to only show content you need, and working with default taxonomies and creating your own.
